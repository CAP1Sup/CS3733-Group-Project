# G.2 Iteration #3
Hello! For testing this app, the grader will need to consider the following:

## Starting Page

The starting page should be the Login Page, and you should start being logged out.

This is the current login info for venue manager and admin. If you want to test being a consumer, you must log out and press I am a consumer


Venue Manager login:
Username: manager@gmail.com
Password: 5994471abb01112afcc18159f6cc74b4f511b99806da59b3caf5a9c173cacfc5

Admin login:
Username: admin@gmail.com
Password: e2217d3e4e120c6a3372a1890f03e232b35ad659d71f7a62501a4ee204a3e66d


## Use Cases

Logging into the Venue Manager page brings you to venue view. The buttons in venue view should work. There are also tabs in the top of the screen for navigating between pages.

In venue view, pressing create venue will bring you to the page to create a venue. 
One a venue is created, you can select that venue and press create show to create a show in that venue.

Fill in the information, press create show, and then go back to the venue view page to see the show. Selecting the venue will show the show, selecting the show name will show the times. Timezones are converted automatically to GMT and should be converted manually back to EST when considering show times

Select the venue, show, and time then press activate show. 

Go to the login page and press log out and I am a consumer to view the consumer end.

Click on the venue to see active shows in that venue.

Click on the venue, show, and time before pressing select seats to go to the menu to see avaliable seats and buy them. 

You must press show seats to make the seats visible

You can click shift on seats to select multiple seats at one from the menu.

For the sake of the current seats, Row 0 is A, Row 1 is B, etc. And Column 0 is 1, Column 1 is 2, etc

Press the back arrow in the browser to go back to active shows and back again for login

The All Shows page is the Administrator view, though venue view also works for admins. Click on the desired venue and then generate show report to bring you to the show report page. You then need to click show report to generate it.
