# G.2 Iteration #1
Hello! For testing this app, the grader will need to consider the following:

## Logins

Due to the way the app is currently WIP, login information will be done by leaving the username and password in the corresponding boxes. There is no login button -- each button ("Create Venue", "Delete Venue", "Create Show") will work based on what is left in the login boxes.

Venue Manager login:
Username: manager@gmail.com
Password: e2217d3e4e120c6a3372a1890f03e232b35ad659d71f7a62501a4ee204a3e66d

Admin login:
Username: admin@gmail.com
Password: e2217d3e4e120c6a3372a1890f03e232b35ad659d71f7a62501a4ee204a3e66d

## Use Cases

For creating venues and shows, just specifying the login info and then filling out the boxes in each section will suffice.
For deleting venues, you will have to hit the List Venues button, which will refresh the generic options with actual venues in the database, then select from the dropdown whichever venue you wish to remove, and finally, hit the "Delete Venue" button.
